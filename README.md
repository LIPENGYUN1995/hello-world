John Rawls----A theory of justice

From the concern of moral, pursue a society with justice. justice is a standard of morality. property-owning democracy(or liberal socialist regime), rather than 福利社会

The main idea of the theory of justice:to find principles of justice for the basic structure of society. 目标：自由与平等的社会个体走在一起进行社会合作，以正义规范。
original position is a purely hypothetical situation./In veil of ignorance(无知之幕), through rational(not a moral conception) choice(parties(幕中之人) are only rational, which means they do not know anything about their values), achieve fair agreement or bargain->the principles of justice.

1. basic of society : two principles of justice(論証social constrict) at an original position. justice of fairs. 
The role of justice: truth in theory=justice in society(?)  a just society=the liberties of equal citizenship(core value)
First principle: each person is to have an equal right  ->  equal basic liberties(平等的基本自由原则)
Second principle: 没有追求结果平等，而是允许social and economic inequalities, but should be arranged under (b)conditions of fair equality of opportunity(公平的机会平等原则);(a)the greatest benefit of the least advantaged((自然による)差異原則differences).
2. imply. equal liberty/distributive shares/duty and obligation
3. Ends(目的) : justice=good(好).

morality(憲法)->制度->個人行為
